            <h2 class="section-title">What is Asthma?</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Asthma is a chronic condition that affects the airways, making it difficult to breathe. The airways become inflamed and narrow, causing difficulty in airflow. Asthma can affect anyone at any age, and its causes vary widely. Understanding the causes is essential for managing the disease effectively.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Common Causes of Asthma</h2>
            <p class="section-text">A variety of factors can contribute to the development of asthma. These causes can be environmental, genetic, or a combination of both.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">1. Genetic Factors</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Asthma often runs in families. If your parents or siblings have asthma, you are more likely to develop it yourself. This suggests a genetic predisposition to the disease. Certain genes that regulate the immune system may make individuals more susceptible to asthma.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">2. Environmental Factors</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Environmental triggers are among the most common causes of asthma. These include allergens and irritants in the air. Some of the key environmental factors include:</p>
            <ul class="section-list">
                <li class="list-item">Dust mites</li>
                <li class="list-item">Pollens</li>
                <li class="list-item">Mold</li>
                <li class="list-item">Animal dander (from pets such as cats and dogs)</li>
                <li class="list-item">Air pollution</li>
                <li class="list-item">Smoke (including tobacco smoke)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">3. Respiratory Infections</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Respiratory infections, particularly in early childhood, may increase the likelihood of developing asthma. Infections such as the common cold or the flu can inflame the airways and trigger asthma symptoms. Some viral infections may also contribute to asthma’s onset or exacerbate existing asthma.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">4. Occupational Exposure</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Some people develop asthma due to exposure to certain chemicals, dust, or fumes at their workplace. This is known as occupational asthma. It can occur in jobs such as construction, farming, or factory work, where individuals are regularly exposed to irritants that trigger asthma symptoms.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">5. Allergies</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Many people with asthma have allergies that trigger or worsen their symptoms. Common allergens include pollen, mold, pet dander, and certain foods. People with allergic asthma may experience symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath when exposed to these allergens.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">6. Exercise and Physical Activity</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Physical activity, especially vigorous exercise, can sometimes trigger asthma symptoms. This is called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). EIB causes narrowing of the airways during or after exercise, resulting in wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">7. Air Pollution</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Outdoor air pollution, including traffic emissions, industrial pollutants, and ozone levels, can trigger asthma symptoms or make the condition worse. People who live in areas with high levels of air pollution are at higher risk of developing asthma or experiencing more frequent asthma attacks.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">8. Weather Conditions</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Extreme weather conditions, such as cold air, humidity, and sudden temperature changes, can also trigger asthma symptoms. Cold air can irritate the airways, while hot, humid weather can make it harder to breathe.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Additional Factors That Contribute to Asthma</h2>
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Stress and Emotions</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Emotional stress, anxiety, and strong emotions can exacerbate asthma symptoms. Stress can lead to shallow breathing and may increase the frequency of asthma attacks.</p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Medications</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Certain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, can trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals. This is particularly true for people who have aspirin-sensitive asthma.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Asthma is a complex condition with multiple potential causes. A combination of genetic factors, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices can all contribute to the development or worsening of asthma. By identifying and managing these causes, individuals with asthma can better control their symptoms and live healthier lives.</p>
