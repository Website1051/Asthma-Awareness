            <h2>Understanding Asthma Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes inflammation in the airways, leading to breathing difficulties. The symptoms of asthma vary in intensity and frequency, and they can be triggered by allergens, weather changes, physical exertion, and infections. Below is a detailed guide on asthma symptoms and their impact.</p>

            <h3>1. Common Symptoms of Asthma</h3>
            <p>The following symptoms are frequently experienced by asthma patients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shortness of Breath:</strong> Difficulty in breathing, especially during physical activities or at night.</li>
                <li><strong>Chest Tightness:</strong> A feeling of pressure or squeezing in the chest.</li>
                <li><strong>Wheezing:</strong> A high-pitched whistling sound when exhaling, often heard during an asthma attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Coughing:</strong> A dry cough that may worsen at night or early in the morning.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty Sleeping:</strong> Asthma symptoms often become worse at night, making it difficult to sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Mucus Production:</strong> Thick mucus build-up in the airways, making breathing more difficult.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Early Warning Signs of an Asthma Attack</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, subtle changes occur before a full-blown asthma attack. Recognizing these signs can help prevent a serious episode:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frequent coughing, especially at night.</li>
                <li>Feeling unusually tired or weak after exercise.</li>
                <li>Wheezing or mild chest discomfort.</li>
                <li>Increased mucus production in the throat.</li>
                <li>Reduced lung function, noticeable through breathlessness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Severe Symptoms – When to Seek Emergency Help</h3>
            <p>If asthma symptoms become severe, immediate medical attention is needed. Warning signs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Severe shortness of breath, even while at rest.</li>
                <li>Inability to speak more than a few words without gasping.</li>
                <li>Blue or gray lips and fingernails, a sign of low oxygen levels.</li>
                <li>Rapid heartbeat or confusion.</li>
                <li>No improvement after using a quick-relief inhaler.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. How Asthma Symptoms Differ by Age</h3>
            <p>Asthma symptoms vary based on age groups:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Children:</strong> Frequent coughing, difficulty playing sports, trouble sleeping due to wheezing.</li>
                <li><strong>Adults:</strong> Chest tightness, increased breathlessness, recurring respiratory infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Older Adults:</strong> More severe asthma attacks, increased reliance on inhalers, difficulty recovering from colds.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Triggers That Worsen Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Asthma symptoms can worsen due to various triggers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Allergens:</strong> Pollen, pet dander, dust mites.</li>
                <li><strong>Respiratory Infections:</strong> Colds, flu, sinus infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Weather Changes:</strong> Cold air, humidity, sudden temperature shifts.</li>
                <li><strong>Smoke and Pollution:</strong> Cigarette smoke, industrial fumes.</li>
                <li><strong>Stress and Strong Emotions:</strong> Anxiety, laughter, crying.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Physical activity can cause exercise-induced asthma.</li>
            </ul>
